[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.0...v1.0.0)

* Routing to edit-reserve form now includes item-ID explicitly. Fixes UICR-58.
* Attempted fix for intermittent `item` resource fetch failures. May fix UICR-57.
* Towards correct sorting for start-date, end-date, instructor and status: see UICR-49 and UICR-50, but note that these will not work until MODCR-21 and its underlying RMB issue are fixed.
* Towards more correct searching in reserves, though underlying issues mean these changes will not yet help: see UICR-31.
* Towards more correct sorting in reserves, though underlying issues mean  these changes will not yet help: see UICR-60.

* New app created from scratch.
* Candidate version for inclusion in FOLIO fireflower (2010q1) release.
