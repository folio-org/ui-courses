* Upgrade to `@folio/stripes` `^5.0`, including `plugin-find-user` `v4`, `react-intl` `v5`, `react-router` `v5`. Fixes UICR-108, UICR-109.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v2.0.0) (2020-07-31)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.7...v2.0.0)

* Add test suite, and [document how it works](doc/testing-with-cypress.md). Fixes UICR-21.
* Correctly import `required` via `@folio/stripes/util`.
* Simplify names of scripts in package file

## [1.1.7](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.7) (2020-05-11)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.6...v1.1.7)

* Fetch and display up to 500 entries in the various dropdowns used in filters and edit pages. Fixes UICR-86.

## [1.1.6](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.6) (2020-05-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.5...v1.1.6)

* In course display, up to 500 reserves can be listed (was 10). Of these, real-time item information is displayed for the first 20; thereafter, circulation status and other item-level information is displayed as `?`. Fixes UICR-85.

## [1.1.5](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.5) (2020-04-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.4...v1.1.5)

* When displaying a course, do not run a spurious item-list GET, based on the reserves listed in the reserve-oriented view, before the correct one. This avoids not only an unnecessary round-trip, but an ugly error message when running against large data-sets. Fixes UICR-82.

## [1.1.4](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.4) (2020-04-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.3...v1.1.4)

* Do not PUT to item when editing a reserve. Related to the MODCR-31 work.

## [1.1.3](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.3) (2020-04-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.2...v1.1.3)

* Hide "Add instructor" button when permission is missing. Fixes UICR-81.

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.2) (2020-04-06)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2)

* Many, many bugfixes, leading to first usable release.
* Change-logging of individual issues will commence with the next release.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.1) (2020-03-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.0) (2020-03-14)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)

* Routing to edit-reserve form now includes item-ID explicitly. Fixes UICR-57.
* Upgrade to `@folio/stripes` v3.x, which is what FOLIO 2020q1 will use. Fixes UICR-58.
* Towards correct sorting for start-date, end-date, instructor and status: see UICR-49 and UICR-50, but note that these will not work until MODCR-21 and its underlying RMB issue are fixed.
* Towards more correct searching in reserves, though underlying issues mean these changes will not yet help: see UICR-31.
* Towards more correct sorting in reserves, though underlying issues mean  these changes will not yet help: see UICR-60.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.0.0) (2020-03-13)

* New app created from scratch.
* Candidate version for inclusion in FOLIO fireflower (2010q1) release.
