[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2)

* A course can now be deleted if _either_ it has no reserves (so none are left danging) _or_ it has one or more cross-listed courses (which continue to hold the reserves). Fixes UICR-102.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.7...v2.0.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.5...v1.1.6)

* In course display, up to 500 reserves can be listed (was 10). Of these, real-time item information is displayed for the first 20; thereafter, circulation status and other item-level information is displayed as `?`. Fixes UICR-85.

## [1.1.5](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.5) (2020-04-28)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.3...v1.1.4)

* Change-logging of individual issues will commence with the next release.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/tree/v1.1.1) (2020-03-16)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-courses/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1)

* Towards more correct searching in reserves, though underlying issues mean these changes will not yet help: see UICR-31.
* Towards more correct sorting in reserves, though underlying issues mean  these changes will not yet help: see UICR-60.
